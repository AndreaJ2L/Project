This program is written in C# based on the topic of the course work. For ease of use by the user,
several windows have been created. Includes several types of groups for sorting goods,
and also added the ability to sort goods by a certain price in a given range. When ordering goods,
it is possible to remove goods from the cart >> If everything is OK, when you click on the next menu button,
you will be redirected to the order form window, where you will need to specify the address to which the product selected by the user will be sent.
